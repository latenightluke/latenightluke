# Late Night Luke

I am a passionate Front-End Developer with a background in UX/UI Design. My primary experience is in Javascript, React, HTML, CSS, C#, and Elixir, but I am always open to learning new languages and tools. I am also proficient in graphics software, primarily Sketch, and the Adobe Software Suite.

Self-improvement is my primary focus in life, I strive to always be learning and improving my craft and becoming a better developer, designer, coworker, and overall human-being.
